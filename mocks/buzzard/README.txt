# Create Mock Files

Created: 27th April, 2023

Here I worked basically on the notebook 2-createDataVector. 
The mock was already made. 
The codes I run to create the mock  are here for reference.
However, I didn't check if it's complete.
For re-creating the mocks I suggest moving to the `LaSerenaSummer2022` repo.
